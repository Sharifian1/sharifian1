## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Chadi ThÃ©lin, a software engineer passionate about building impactful solutions in web development and blockchain.

- Currently working on my own **SMMA platform** called KeyThoughts, hosted in an organization account. Check it out [here](https://github.com/KeyThoughts/agency).
  - Latest update: Implemented a Notion API integration that syncs data from Notion databases to remote databases using Prisma. View the code [here](https://github.com/KeyThoughts/agency/blob/main/src/app/api/notion/webhook/route.ts).
- Recently built a **dynamic reviews carousel** that pulls real Google Maps reviews via the Google Places API â€” keeping business websites fresh and engaging. Check it out [here](https://github.com/Sharifian1/PlaceID-Carousel-Review).
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects in **web applications, blockchain tools, or API integrations**.
